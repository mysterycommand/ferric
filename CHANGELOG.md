# 1.0.0 (2019-04-01)


### Bug Fixes

* **package.json:** make the current version 0 so the semantic-release script can write 1.0.0 over it ([6843fde](https://github.com/mysterycommand/ferric/commit/6843fde))


### Features

* **boilerplate:** it's there, it's barebones, but here it is ([22d50eb](https://github.com/mysterycommand/ferric/commit/22d50eb))
